# 🎮 Dodge The Block

Dodge Master is a fast-paced 2D arcade survival game built in C++ using the raylib graphics library. The objective is simple — survive as long as you can while dodging falling enemies!

Inspired by classic arcade games, this project helped me learn real-time game mechanics, input handling, collision detection, and basic UI drawing using raylib.

## 🚀 Features

* 🕹️ Simple yet addictive gameplay

* 🎯 Real-time movement and collision detection

* ☁️ Falling obstacles based on difficulty

* 🔊 sound effects
